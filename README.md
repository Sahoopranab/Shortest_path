# Shortest_path

The provided C code on GitHub implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. The program calculates the shortest path from a specified starting node to all other nodes in the graph. The code takes user input for the number of vertices and the cost matrix representing the edge weights between nodes. It then applies the Dijkstra algorithm, utilizing arrays for tracking distances, predecessors, and visited nodes.
